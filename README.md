# THE TERMINAL

![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GBvcyg3awAAqYtS?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

This artwork captures the essence of a terminal interface, visualizing the vibrant pixels that form the backbone of a command-line interface (CLI). The spectrum of colors within the CLI symbolizes the dynamic exchange of life between the real and digital worlds, highlighting the continuous interplay of existence across these realms. It poses a profound question: in our relentless quest for efficiency, might humanity risk losing its soul to the digital abyss?

## Digital Artwork (NFT)

This digital asset is minted fully on-chain with SVG code and an infinite looping animation directly to the Ethereum blockchain. Ownership enables the token owner to claim the physical version.

## Physical Artwork 

24” W x 36” H, wood panel, mixed media underlay, colored vinyl, iridescent powder and mod podge coating, custom led mount bars, and arduino coded animations, wireless powerblock.

The physical finish embodies a cyberpunk interpretation of contemporary art, employing a street artist's weathered, imperfect wheatpaste technique, while the resulting artwork stands as a flawless, modern representation at the cutting edge of innovative artistry.

There is a perfection to the imperfect.

### Repository Assets

## Artist Process

Created by 1980k. A beautiful journey of exploration. Insight into the steps to create this artwork. 
1. Custom-coded generative pattern in p5js. Unlimited patterns can be generated. 
2. Converted the p5js to an SVG. Added SVG animation code.
3. Minted fully onchain to the Ethereum Blockchain.
4. Printed, painted, vinyl, and finished the artwork onto a wood panel.
5. Custom-made metal LED mounts, soldered, wired, and mounted Arduino hardware.
6. Custom-coded LED animation to simulate a green dot blinking when connected to the uploading data.

Since the pattern is code, there are unlimited uses, such as shoes and other products I've explored.
